"""
Alphabetical order? sorted. O(nlogn)
Prefix Tree / Trie works but better solution : Two Pointers
Eliminate words : never consider them again
Words that match prefix will always be next to each other because they are sorted.

- Go character by character (does it have m (do both for L and R pointer))
[
L    mobile
    moneypot
    monitor
    mouse
R    mousepad
]
L[i] == m and R[i] == m so words in between them : also match : return 3 lexicographically (top 3 elements from L)
Return sublist
