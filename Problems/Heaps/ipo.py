class Solution:
    '''
    2 arrays give : capital and profit. w = 0 at first, need to maximise w
    profits = [1,2,3] : can take atmost k elements out of profits : 2,3 : 0 + 2 + 3 : 5
      Only catch here : the profit we're adding, correpsonding capital <= w (which in this case wasn't since 1 <=! 0) :: so we can only take 0 as first : 0 <= 0 : add 1 (corresponding profit) : 0 + 1 = 1 (now we can take 3 : 1 + 3 = 4) answer w = 4
    capital = [0,1,1]

    Use max heap for profits so we can get the max element : 3,2,1 (not a good idea since 3 can't be popped at beginning since w = 0 and capital[3] = 1 (1 !<= 0))
    Initialise heap with values that can be added to w => (1,0) : (profit, capital)
      Pop element 1, check if w <= 0 (it is) add to w.
      Now max heap is empty. As our capital changes we have access to more profit elements

    Use a min heap for remaining elements (2,3) based on capital (1,1) :: pop min value : 1, check if w <= capital : it is. Push it to max heap and add answer to w

  Pattern : 2 Heaps : max heap on profits (to figure out most profit )and min heap on capacity (to figure out least capacity so it can be compared to w and be added to max heap and then w can be incremented)

  Time : O(k * log(n)), Space : O(n)

        return w
