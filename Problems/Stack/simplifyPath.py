# /abc/.. -> /abc [.. -> root dire : pop abc and .. ignored] : /
# single dots are always ignored and trailing / also removed.

# /../abc//./def/ 
# / .. (out one direct but we're in root direc so not possible : no pop, ignore)
# //abc : multiple slash : ignore
# /abc/def
# Ignore slash, dots, no trailing slash
# if .. and in root -> ignore, else pop (.. means pop -> remove most recently added element)

# Time and Space : O(N)
