# https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-frequency-stack
'''
stack is LIFO
  implement stack, pop operation : pop the most frequent element
    but if there is tie of 2 most frequent element : pop the one which has been added recently (normal pop)

Initialise two dictionaries set and freq and a variable max_freq.
freq is used to store the frequency of the elements provided, i.e., Key: Element; Value: Count of that element
set is used to store the group of elements having the same frequency. Key: Count; Value: List of elements
max_freq is used to store the frequency of most common element.
For example, let's say we have an input stack and we start adding the following elements:
Push 5: freq: {5: 1}; set: {1: [5]}; max_freq = 1
Push 7: freq: {5: 1, 7: 1}; set: {1: [5, 7]}; max_freq = 1
Push 5: freq: {5: 2, 7: 1}; set: {1: [5, 7], 2:[5]}; max_freq = 2
Pop:
  Use max_freq to access the set dictionary and pop the last element from the list.
  val = set[max_freq].pop()
  Since, our set[2] is empty, decrement max_freq by 1.
  Also, decrement freq[val] by 1.
  freq: {5:1, 7: 1}; set: {1: [5, 7], 2: []}; max_freq = 1
  return val
