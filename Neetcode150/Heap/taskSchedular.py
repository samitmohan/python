'''
AAABBCC
Hashmap : {A : 3, B : 2, C : 2}
n (waiting time) = 1

Best to pick most frequent character first so we're never idle even in waiting time
If we pick C first
  CBCBA_A_A_A = NAHHHH : 9
Pick A first
  ABCABCA : minimises the IDLE time : 7

MaxHeap : Configure which task if frequent : O(log(26))
Count occurence of each task and pop and add to maxHeap : O(n)

Time : n + time to process (1 second per task)
Queue to add task and time
'''

import heapq
# Time : O(n(log(n))) Space : O(n) (Counter takes nlogn)
# Round Robin technique (queue needed for tasks which are waiting for cool down period)
# Iterate till all the tasks are processed.
# Pick the task from heap having the maximum frequency.
# Since only one task can be processed in a unit time. So process the task. frequency -= 1
# Now if this task is left then it will have to wait for the cooldown period.
# So, add queue the task till its cooldown period is expired. (cooldown period : time taken by task + n)
# At end : process the tasks whose cooling period is expired.
