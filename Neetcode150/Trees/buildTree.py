'''
2 Observations
1. 1st value in preorder list : always ROOT. 
    3
   /  \
  9    20
      /  \
     15    7
preorder = [3,9,20,15,7], inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
now preorder = [9,20,15,7] : 1st value always root -> take sublist -> do it again recursively

2. How to know what value goes to left and right side? inorder list.
  Once root identified from preorder, locate the same in inorder : [9,   3,   15,20,7] : index : 1 # mid
    all values <- 3 are on left and -> 3 are on right of tree.
      partition the array in a similar way. [9    20,15,7] now recursively solve : root = 9, and then root = 20, locate value in inorder form parition L and R : solve again.

class Solution:
    def buildTree(self, preorder: List[int], inorder: List[int]) -> Optional[TreeNode]:
        if not preorder or not inorder: return None
        root = TreeNode(preorder[0])  # root will always be 1st val of preorder
        # locate that value in inorder = mid
        mid = inorder.index(preorder[0])
        # partition left and right
        # left : 1 - mid for both PO and IO (why 1? because first element in preorder is root)
        # ruight : mid - end for both PO and IO
        root.left = self.buildTree(preorder[1: mid + 1], inorder[: mid])
        root.right = self.buildTree(preorder[mid + 1:], inorder[mid + 1:])

        return root
