# Cyclic Sort way of doing it.

0 - N for 3
0 1 2 3

In cyclic sort every index = value - 1 but that's for range 1-N, here from 0-N
    it will be index = value

# 3 is missing
0 1 2 3
4 0 2 1 

index 4 does not exist? ignore (i++)

0 1 2 3
4 0 2 1 

is 0 at correct place (index = value), no it is not. swap
0 1 2 3
0 4 2 1

is 2 at correct place? yes.

is 1 at correct place? no. swap

0 1 2 3
0 1 2 4

does 0 contain 0 yes does 1 contain 1 yes does 2 contain 2 yes does 3 contain 3 no
    return 3

Case 2 : when N is not there in array.
n = 4
arr = [1, 0, 3, 2]
0 1 2 3
0 1 2 3

answer = n : 4
