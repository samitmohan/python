# Input: heights = [2,1,5,6,2,3]
# Output: 10
# Explanation: The above is a histogram where width of each bar is 1.
# The largest rectangle is shown in the red area, which has an area = 10 units.

'''
Cases :
  1 -> [2,1] : can't extend it as there will be a gap since 2 > 1
  2 -> [1,2] : can extend it easily to get a area of 2 since there will be no gap 1 < 2
  3 -> [2,2] : can also extend it easily to get an area of 4

Can only compute area if heights are in increasing order. If not in increasing order (2,1) : stack = [2] pop it from stack [1]
[1,2,3,4,3] : till 4 -> area but then 3 is the next element which cannot be included, hence pop 4 from stack
  # new : [1,2,3,3] : area = 6
Similar example
  [1,2,3,4,1] till 4 -> area = 4, then 1. pop 4, 3, 2 because 1 < all, new stack : [1,1] which gives largest area of 2

Stack : hold index and height
compute and return maxArea_so_far
