# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, x: int, next: 'Node' = None, random: 'Node' = None):
        self.val = int(x)
        self.next = next
        self.random = random
        
Every node ALSO has a random pointer (could be pointing anywhere (null, random node etc..))
Deep copy (clone the nodes) : new memory (create new LL)
5 nodes in inp -> 5 nodes in op
  Difficulty : random pointers 
  Cloning nodes : [1,2,3]
    3rd node random ptr -> 5th node but we haven't gotten to that node yet : 2 passes/loops
    1st pass : take input node and create deep copy of all nodes (no links)
      also going to create a hashmap (original node -> new node) old node to new copy map
    2nd pass : link the nodes (next and random pointers) [leverage hashmap to get to map every old node to new node] hm : 3->5 so in our copy also copy3 -> copy5
