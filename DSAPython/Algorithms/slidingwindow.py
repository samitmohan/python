# Sliding winodw : overlapping subproblems in O(N) time

# Find sum of sub-arrays
# k = 3

# [1+2+3], [2+3+4], [3+4+5] -> we're computing 2+3 again : O(N * k)
# first subarray : include one do not include 4
# second subarray : dont include one but include 4
# only thing that changes : first and last value

# [1+2+3] = 6
# exlude one and include 4 : 6 - 1 + 4
# k = 5
# [1,2,3,4,5] [2,3,4,5,6] : large overlap between these subarrays
# subtract first val and add last val to sum

# Most likely : use hashmaps with sliding window problems
# Window size : r + l - 1
# Always right += 1 and left += 1 when window size reached
